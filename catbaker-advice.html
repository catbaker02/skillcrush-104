				<p>Learning to code takes time, so be patient with yourself. When you start on a new journey, there's a
				big learning curve. Realize you are not going to perfect all the coding skills overnight. Be very patient
				with yourself. It is okay if all tasks don't go as planned. This does not mean that you are failure...
				It just means that you are learning. Learning something new takes time.So you have to tell yourself to
				breathe and be patient.</p>

				<h4>A fresh perspective is sometimes the key.</h4>
				<p> When you are learning to code there are times when things are not working as you thought they would.
				Even when you try different ways to problem solve, it might continue to not go according to plan... It is
				important to realize that this can happen. It doesn't mean you are a failure. You are learning! When you
				feel like you are hitting a wall due to frustration, take a break. Your vision at the momement is clouded
				by frustration. A break will give you the fresh perspective that is needed to solve the problem.</p>

				<h4>Google is your<br>best friend</h4>
				<p>When you are trying to solve problems that vex you, look no further than GOOGLE. This is an
				invaluable resource. Google can help you find the solution to the problem you are encountering
			  with code. It can also provide you with a resource that can help to enhance your understanding of
			  a coding concept.</p>
